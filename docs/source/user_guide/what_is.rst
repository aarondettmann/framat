What is |name|?
===============

|name_bold| (|name_long|) is a FEM_ implementation of the |eb| beam theory (also known as classical or engineering beam theory). The tool was initially written for a low-fidelity aeroelasticity_ model, but |name| is a general purpose FE_ beam implementation. Most notably, |name| provides the following functionality.

* Elaborate definition of the beam geometry and properties
* Elaborate definition of loads

    * Concentrated loads
    * Distributed loads
    * Gravity loads
    * Point loads with an offset to the beam axis

* Python library for model generation
* Highly customisable plots
* Hooks for post-processing
* High automation
* Ability to be integrated in aeroelastic frameworks
